# Using ITM Console for Redirecting Prints and LWIP Debug Messages on a HTTP example

## Summary

This Repo provides an example of usage of the ITM (Instrumentation Trace Macrocell) console to redirect print statements and LWIP debug messages in STM32CubeIDE. These tools are invaluable for debugging and optimizing your embedded applications involving LWIP middleware and related to Networking application such as Ethernet based applications.
in our case we are implementing a HTTP server with FreeRTOS with a fictive web page as HTML data to be displayed.

## Prerequisites

This project utilizes the following software and hardware environment:

- STM32_NUCLEO_F439 
- STM32CubeIDE v1.16
- STM32CubeMX v6.12
